# loan-prediction-modeling
In this project, we are going to develop a machine learning model to predict the score and classify a customer of the financial company "Prêt à dépenser" if he repays his credit or not based on various data sources (behavioral data, data from other financial institutions, etc.).
We find that the most important classification model are LGBM and logistic regression.
